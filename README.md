# Beginner Java Projects
These are a series of beginner Java projects that I did when I was 15 years old.

-- Tic Tac Toe -- 
This I did when I was 15 years old. I made and finished it on 10/28/2017 (Saturday October 28th.) I spent a year experimenting with programming and trying things and accomplishing nothing, and after postponing C++, decided to transfer over the project to Java, which I eventually completed. 

-- Hang Man --
This I too did when I was 15. Completed it after review from other programmers on 11/9/2017 (Thursday October 9th 2017). I feel like I'm actually making progress. I can't believe I waited til now to do projects. I gravely underestimated myself.
