# Beginner Java Projects
These are a series of beginner Java projects that I did when I was 15 years old.

This I did when I was 15 years old. I made and finished it on 10/28/2017 (Saturday October 28th.) I spent a year experimenting with programming and trying things and accomplishing nothing, and after postponing C++, decided to transfer over the project to Java, which I eventually completed.
